A library that implements complex arithmetic in Java, providing a simple, easy-to-understand and fluent API.

It allows operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, power elevation, and complex roots; as well as finding complex roots of quadratic equations.
Addition of multiple complex numbers uses Kahan summation algorithm (compensated summation) for reducing numeric cancellation when computing the sum of several numbers.

Recently, tests and bug fixes have been done. Furthermore, a clear JavaDoc have been added.
More in-depth tests will be done to make the code much more stable, robust and reliable. 

The README.md will be updated in the future to describe the main use cases.
